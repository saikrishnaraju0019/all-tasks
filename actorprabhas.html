        The film's initial story was pitched from Neel's debut film Ugramm (2014) and is the maiden part of a two-part
        film. It was officially announced in December 2020 under the title Salaar, however, in July 2023, the official
        title was announced as <small>Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire. Principal photography commenced in January
            2021</small>, and occurred

        included
        <q>Telangana, Italy and Budapest</q>. Production difficulties, ranging from the pandemic, reshoots and VFX
