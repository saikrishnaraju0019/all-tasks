        The Death Note process began when Ohba brought thumbnails for two concept ideas to Shueisha; Ohba said that
        the
        Death Note pilot, one of the concepts, was "received well" by editors and attained positive reactions from
        readers.Ohba described keeping the story of the pilot to one chapter as "very difficult", declaring that it
        took over a month to begin writing the chapter. He added that the story had to revive the killed characters
        with
        the Death Eraser and that he "didn't really care" for that plot device.

        Obata said that he wanted to draw the story after he heard of a "horror story featuring shinigami".According
        to Obata, when he first received the rough draft created by Ohba, he "didn't really get it" at first, and he
        wanted to work on the project due to the presence of shinigami and because the work "was dark".He also said
        he wondered about the progression of the plot as he read the thumbnails, and if Jump readers would enjoy
        reading
        the comic. Obata said that while there is little action and the main character "doesn't really drive the
        plot",
        he enjoyed the atmosphere of the story. He stated that he drew the pilot chapter so that it would appeal to
        himself.

        Ohba brought the rough draft of the pilot chapter to the editorial department. Obata came into the picture
        at a
        later point to create the artwork. They did not meet in person while creating the pilot chapter. Ohba said
        that
        the editor told him he did not need to meet with Obata to discuss the pilot; Ohba said "I think it worked
        out
        all right".

            The core plot device of the story is the "Death Note" itself, a black notebook with instructions (known as
            "Rules of the Death Note") written on the inside. When used correctly, it allows anyone to commit a murder,
            knowing only the victim's name and face. According to the director of the live-action films, Shusuke Kaneko,
            "The idea of spirits living in words is an ancient Japanese concept.... In a way, it's a very Japanese
            story".

            Artist Takeshi Obata originally thought of the books as "Something you would automatically think was a Death
            Note". Deciding that this design would be cumbersome, he instead opted for a more accessible college
            notebook. Death Notes were originally conceived as changing based on time and location, resembling scrolls
            in ancient Japan, or the Old Testament in medieval Europe. However, this idea was never used.

        <p>It was reported in September 2009, that a Year Eight boy in Sydney, Australia, created a "Death Note" that
            along with names contained a "battle plan" detailing where bombs could be placed inside his school.In
            December 2009, two students at an elementary school in Oklahoma were disciplined for a "Death Note" with the
            names and descriptions of deaths of two girls that had angered them.A Michigan middle school student was
            suspended indefinitely in March 2010 for a "Death Note".In May 2010, a middle school student in Avonworth
            School District in Pennsylvania was suspended for a "Death Note" with names of fellow students and pop
            singer Justin Bieber.In February 2015, a fifth-grade student of an elementary school near Pittsburgh was
            suspended for owning a "Death Note" and writing other students' names in it.
