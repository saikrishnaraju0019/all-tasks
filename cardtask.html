                    The Land Rover Defender (initially introduced as the Land Rover 110 / One Ten, and in 1984 joined by
                    the
                    Land
                    Rover 90 / Ninety, plus the new, extra-length Land Rover 127 in 1985) is a series of British
                    off-road
                    cars
                    and pickup trucks. They consistently have four-wheel drive, and were developed in the 1980s from the
                    original Land Rover series which was launched at the Amsterdam Motor Show in April 1948. Following
                    the
                    1989
                    introduction of the Land Rover Discovery, the term 'Land Rover' became the name of a broader marque,
                    and
                    thus no longer worked as the name of a specific model; thus in 1990 Land Rover renamed the 90 and
                    110 as
                    Defender 90 and Defender 110 respectively. The 127 became the Defender 130.

                    The vehicle, a British equivalent of the Second World War derived (Willys) Jeep, gained a worldwide
                    reputation for ruggedness and versatility. Using a steel ladder chassis and an aluminium alloy
                    bodywork,
                    the
                    Land Rover originally used detuned versions of Rover engines. The original Defender is still being
                    produced
                    in developing countries despite the arrival of the Land Rover Defender (L663).

                    Lexus (レクサス, Rekusasu) is the luxury vehicle division of the Japanese automaker Toyota Motor
                    Corporation. The Lexus brand is marketed in more than 90 countries and territories worldwide[3][6]
                    and
                    is Japan's largest-selling make of premium cars. It has ranked among the 10 largest Japanese global
                    brands in market value.[7] Lexus is headquartered in Nagoya, Japan. Operational centers are located
                    in
                    Brussels, Belgium, and Plano, Texas, United States.

                    Created at around the same time as Japanese rivals Honda and Nissan created their Acura and Infiniti
                    luxury divisions respectively, Lexus originated from a corporate project to develop a new premium
                    sedan,
                    code-named F1, which began in 1983 and culminated in the launch of the Lexus LS in 1989.[8]
                    Subsequently, the division added sedan, coupé, convertible and SUV models. Lexus did not exist as a
                    brand in its home market until 2005, and all vehicles marketed internationally as Lexus from 1989 to
                    2005 were released in Japan under the Toyota marque and an equivalent model name. In 2005, a hybrid
                    version of the RX crossover debuted and additional hybrid models later joined the division's lineup.
                    Lexus launched its own F marque performance division in 2007 with the debut of the IS F sport sedan,
                    followed by the LFA supercar in 2009.
