        The wreck of the Titanic lies at a depth of about 12,500 feet (3,800 metres; 2,100 fathoms), about 370 nautical
        miles (690 kilometres) south-southeast off the coast of Newfoundland. It lies in two main pieces about 2,000
        feet (600 m) apart. The bow is still recognisable with many preserved interiors, despite deterioration and
        damage sustained hitting the sea floor. In contrast, the stern is heavily damaged. A debris field around the
        wreck contains hundreds of thousands of items spilled from the ship as she sank. The bodies of the passengers
        and crew would also be distributed across the seabed, but have since been consumed by other organisms.
